### **Primary Colors (Dominant) – Mood & Atmosphere**

These are the **most prevalent colors** in the scene and define the overall **mood, lighting, and time of day**.

- **Purpose**: Establish tone and environment (e.g., the blue in your mage library conveys mystery, coldness, or magic).
    
- **Examples**: Deep blues, stone grays, parchment browns in your PS1-style mage library.
    
- **Importance**: **Highest** – anchors your entire visual theme.

### **2. Secondary Colors (Supportive) – Depth & Structure**

These **complement the primary colors**, often used in shadows, architecture, or contrasting elements.

- **Purpose**: Add **volume**, differentiate **foreground from background**, guide the eye.
    
- **Examples**: Warm highlights like brass, maroon, or orange tones within shadowed books or sconces.
    
- **Importance**: **Moderate** – creates **readability** and enhances dimensionality.

### **3. Tertiary Colors (Accents) – Focus & Interaction**

These are **used sparingly**, often for **visual interest**, **gameplay affordance**, or to **highlight key objects**.

- **Purpose**: Draw attention to points of interaction, danger, or importance (e.g., glowing crystals, UI elements).
    
- **Examples**: Electric blues of the crystals, green hues of magic, glowing orange potions.
    
- **Importance**: **Targeted** – limited use, but **high impact** when applied strategically.

If you're building a PS1-style 3D scene, follow this principle:

- Let **primary colors guide emotional tone**,
    
- Use **secondary hues to layer geometry**,
    
- And let **tertiary colors “pop”** at interaction points or for magic/sci-fi visual contrast.
    

Let me know if you'd like this applied to a palette reference or scene breakdown.

If you want, I can also turn this into a hex color palette reference or give you a Unity/Unreal color grading LUT setup based on this breakdown.
