### Enemy and Combat Mechanics

Enemy design and count should follow the model established in _Hogwarts Legacy_, as its level scale closely matches the scale of Avernoth. That Hogwarts typically features up to six enemies per encounter, providing a solid baseline for maintaining pressure without overwhelming the player.

To increase intensity while maintaining clarity in combat, encounters can scale to 8â€“10 enemies in Avernoth.
This count should adapt based on enemy archetype.

For example:

**Level 1 Encounter**

- 6 Fodder Enemies (Weak)
    
- 2 Elite Enemies (Strong)
    

**Level 2 Encounter**

- 2 Fodder Enemies
    
- 4 Elite Enemies
    
- 2 Ranged Enemies
    

This approach shifts the design philosophy toward **enemy combinations** rather than raw quantity, allowing more room for strategic play and visual readability.
